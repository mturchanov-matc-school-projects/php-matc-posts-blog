<p class=""pseudo-lorem> Throughout history, the purpose of a human’s life has changed. Obviously, there is no universal purpose,
but by analyzing own experience, modern literature, and overall surroundings we can say about the
majority’s purpose. However, I am sure that through the exploring of this world we become closer to 'this'. So, I invite you to join this exploration and reveal
new sights.</p>
